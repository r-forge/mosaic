\subsection{Lady Tasting Tea}
If you don't use the Lady Tasting Tea as a course starter, you can use it as 
an introduction to testing a proportion.

\subsection{Golfballs in the Yard}



\section{Bootstrap?}

Do any of us do bootstrap in intro courses?  Other courses?  Do we want to include this?
Robin Lock is big on bootstrap.  Do we need any bootstrap tools in the \verb!mosaic! 
package?

Danny responds: We already have good-enough bootstrap tools in the
package: \texttt{do} and \texttt{resample}.  I don't do bootstrapping
early in the course, but I do talk about sampling variability from day
1.  Later on, I introduce bootstrapping as a way to simulate sampling
variability without having to collect more data.
